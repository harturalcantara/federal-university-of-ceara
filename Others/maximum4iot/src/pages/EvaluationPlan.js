            The purpose of this process is to guide software engineers in the
            evaluation activities of an Internet of Things application. This
            process is suitable for IoT applications because it includes a
            repository of NFRs and software quality measures that meet the
            specificities of IoT applications. It also suggests specific
            techniques and tools for qualitatively evaluating the application.
            The intention is that the process can be used by people with or
            without previous experience in evaluation and that it can be used
            during the application development cycle or after its
            implementation. The following diagram illustrates the flow of
            activities suggested by Maximum4IoT:

              <p>
                <b>Step 1:</b> The first step is to select the non-functional
                requirements that the evaluators will observe during the
                evaluation. The assessors will check the Maximum Repository,
                where they can find a list of non-functional requirements for
                IoT applications. For this phase, it is essential to involve the
                stakeholders to ensure that the evaluation covers all the
                critical aspects of the system.{" "}

                Suppose the evaluator intends to assess the application both
                qualitatively and quantitatively. In that case, it is advisable
                to conduct the qualitative evaluation before starting the
                software measurement process, thus moving on to Step 2 -
                Preparing the qualitative evaluation. In this way, the evaluator
                can identify and resolve system interaction problems before
                planning the software measurement. If the evaluator decides not
                to perform the qualitative evaluation, he/she can skip to Step 6
                - Preparing the Software Measurement.

              <p>
                In this way, the evaluator can identify and resolve system
                interaction problems before planning the software measurement.
                If the evaluator decides not to perform the HCI evaluation, they
                can skip to Step 6 - Preparing the Software Measurement.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 2:</b> Before starting the HCI evaluation, it is necessary
              to plan it, clarify its objectives, and establish which questions
              will be answered. One way to guide the planning of an evaluation
              is through the DECIDE method (PREECE et al.,2013), which invites
              the evaluator to answer seven items that will help structure the
              evaluation. This framework can be accessed via the Maximum
              Repository, which also provides a list of evaluation artifacts
              that can be used to conduct HCI evaluations of IoT applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 3:</b> The evaluator must conduct the HCI evaluation using
              the evaluation plan drawn up during Step 2. It is worth
              emphasizing the importance of recording the data collected so that
              all the data gathered is registered and the evaluation retains its
              validity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 4:</b> The evaluator analyzes the data collected through
              the HCI evaluation and draws a report summarizing the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 5:</b> If the project context allows, the problems
              identified in the HCI evaluation can be corrected before moving on
              to the software quality evaluation. As with Step 1, it is up to
              the evaluator whether to conduct a new HCI evaluation to check
              whether the errors identified in the evaluation persist after the
              improvements made to the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                <b>Step 6:</b> The evaluator will define the measurement plan to
                start the software quality evaluation. The measurement plan
                defines the software measures that will be collected, according
                to the NFRs chosen in step 1, as well as determining the
                activities to be carried out to collect the measures, who will
                carry them out, the assessment environment, the instruments
                needed and how the data will be interpreted.
              </p>
              <p>
                For planning, the evaluator can use the Maximum4IoT repository,
                which presents a set of quality measures applicable to the
                context of Internet of Things systems. Suppose the measures
                chosen by the evaluator need to be better defined (without
                measurement function, collection method, or interpretation). In
                that case, we recommend using the GQM approach (BASILI et al.,
                1994), which identifies the overall objectives for the
                evaluation and helps define metrics based on the objective. A
                more detailed explanation of the GQM approach is available in
                the repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to note that once the evaluator has decided to
                develop new measures, they must follow a structure that allows
                them to be carried out correctly. The measure must have a name,
                a description, a measurement function, an interpretation, and a
                collection method (CARVALHO et al., 2018).
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 7:</b> The software quality evaluation starts following
              the step-by-step established during the measurement plan, with
              software measures corresponding to the non-functional requirements
              defined in Step 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 8:</b> The software quality evaluation results are
              analyzed and reported to the stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Step 9:</b> If the project context allows, the development team
              can fix the problems reported. Once the problems have been fixed,
              a new software quality evaluation is carried out to see whether
              the changes have positively or negatively impacted the measures.
              If the evaluator chooses not to continue fixing the problems
              reported or if the developers have fixed all the problems
              identified, the NFR evaluation flow is closed for this IoT
              application. If followed in its entirety, this process returns two
              results to the evaluators: a report for the HCI evaluation of the
              system and a report for the software quality evaluation.
